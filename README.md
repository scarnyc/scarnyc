## 👋 Hey, I'm Will

I build 0 → 1 AI products that deliver real business impact — $168M+ in revenue growth and cost savings that 100M+ customers ❤️

Most of my work bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI and practical customer value: agentic systems, RAG pipelines, LLM evaluation frameworks, and production-scale deployments.

I lead the open-source [deep-agent-agi](https://github.com/scarnyc/deep-agent-agi) framework — a general-purpose deep agent that reduces AI tool costs through intelligent reasoning optimization.
